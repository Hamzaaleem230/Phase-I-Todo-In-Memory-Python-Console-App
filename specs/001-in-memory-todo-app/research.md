# Research: In-Memory Todo Console App

No research was required for this feature as the specification was self-contained and all technical requirements were explicitly defined in the project constitution.

## Decisions

- **Language**: Python 3.13+ (per constitution)
- **Data Storage**: In-memory dictionary (per constitution)
- **ID Generation**: Simple integer increment (per spec clarification)
- **CLI Framework**: None, pure standard library (per constitution)
